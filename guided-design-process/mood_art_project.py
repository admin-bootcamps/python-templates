Give an image prompt that would generate a visualisation of the mood(s) you're given. The mood should be represented by colours, motion, flows and patterns in the image, rather than having a subject or scene. Here are some examples of descriptions you might use:

happy: bright yellows, soft curves, sunny light;
joyful: radiant oranges, playful shapes, sparkles and confetti;
excited: vivid oranges and pinks, dynamic lines, bursts of light;
calm: cool greens and blues, smooth waves, peaceful balance;
relaxed: pale blues, horizontal lines, slow movement, open space;
sad: muted blues, slow flowing water, soft shadows."""

# example_happy_sad.jpeg

    # Describe your emotion or feeling in words: happy and a bit sad

    # Generated Image Prompt: Create an abstract image that blends warm, vibrant yellows and soft oranges to evoke happiness, flowing seamlessly into cooler shades of blue and gentle purples to represent a hint of sadness. Incorporate swirling patterns that mix energetic brush strokes with softer, more delicate lines, creating a sense of motion that captures the complexity of these emotions. The overall composition should have a harmonious balance, with light radiating from the center, gradually fading into darker hues at the edges, symbolizing the interplay between joy and melancholy.
